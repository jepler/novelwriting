<H1>About Novelwriting</H1>

<P>Novelwriting is a Python program for rule-based generation of text, similar
to the Dada Engine.

<P>The name is chosen for the Monty Python skit, available on such recordings as
"Monty Python The Final Rip-Off", which purports to be a live radio broadcast
of the writing of a novel.


<H1>Invoking novelwriting from the command-line</H1>

<PRE>
$ novelwriting spam.nw
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
$ novelwriting < spam.nw
</PRE>

<H1>The grammar of .nw files</H1>

<P>Outside of a token, whitespace is ignored.

<P>Comments begin with a "#" and continue until the end of the line.

<P>A "Name" begins with a letter or underline (_) and continues with zero
or more letters, dashes (-), underlines or digits.  For instance, these
are all names:
<UL>
    <LI>abc
    <LI>_123
    <LI>A_B_C
    <LI>a-b-c
</UL>

<P>A "String" starts with a double quote ("), and continues to the first
unescaped quote.  Inside the string, a sequence composed of a backslash
and another character has a special meaning:
<UL>
    <LI>\"	Inserts a quote inside the string
    <LI>\\	Inserts a backslash inside the string
    <LI>\n	Inserts a newline inside the string
</UL>
<P>See the Python reference manual for a full explanation of the handling of
\-escapes in a string.  For instance, these are all strings:
<UL>
    <LI>"hello world"
    <LI>"A quote: \".  A backslash: \\, A newline: \n"
</UL>

<P>A "Number" (integer) starts with an optional "-" to signify negation,
a nonzero digit and is followed by zero or more digits (including zero),
or simply 0.  For instance, these are all numbers:
<UL>
    <LI>0
    <LI>1
    <LI>-10
    <LI>999
</UL>

<P>The grammar includes other tokens.  In the rules below, the required
sequence of characters is shown inside quotation marks.  "?" follows
an optional item, "*" signals zero-or-more and "+" signals 1 or more of
the preceeding item. "(" and ")" are used for grouping.
<PRE>
    start: prods ";;" python-code;
    prods: prod+;
</PRE>
<P>The entire grammar is a series of "productions" followed by two semicolons
and then additional Python code required by the productions.  "python-code"
is any sequence of characters up to the end of the file.

<P>A production has a name and a list of alternatives it produces:
<PRE>
    prod: Name ":" alt ";";
</PRE>

<P>A list of alternatives is separated by "|".  When executing the grammar, 
one of the alternatives is selected and sent to the output.
<PRE>
    alt: seq ("|" seq)*;
</PRE>

<P>A sequence is composed repetitions or groups:
<PRE>
    seq: rep | "(" alt ")";
    rep: atom ("*" | "+" | "?")?;
</PRE>

<P>An atom is a Name, a String, or a call:
<PRE>
    atom: Name | String | call;
</PRE>

<P>A call is marked by "@", names the function called, and lists the arguments
to the function:
<PRE>
    call: "@" dotted-name "(" args ")";
    args: arg ("," arg)* | NOTHING ;
    arg: seq | Number;
    dotted-name: Name ("." Name)*;
</PRE>

<P>Production starts with a rule called "Start" (if there is one), or the rule
defined earliest in the file otherwise.


<H1>A simple grammar</H1>
    
<PRE>
Start: folk-saying;
folk-saying: person " once said that " folk-saying ".\n";
person: "My " relative | "The President" | "Cardinal Fang";
relative: "mother" | "aunt" | "grandmother" ;
folk-saying: "a rolling stone gathers no moss"
    | "a stitch in time saves nine"
    | "no-one expects the Spanish Inquisition";
;;
</PRE>

<H2>Two possible outputs from the grammar</H2>
<PRE>
My mother once said that no-one expects the Spanish Inquisition.
Cardinal Fang once said that a stitch in time saves nine.
</PRE>


<H1>Using "@-calls" (increasing novelwriting's power with Python)</H1>

<P>You can execute an arbitrary Python function by writing an @-call in
a production.  The function is called with its arguments, and the return
value is inserted into the generated output.  If you write an @-call 
with dashes in the dotted-name part, the dashes are converted to underlines
to find the function to call.

<P>For instance, if you wanted to output four folk sayings, you could
an @-call:
<PRE>
Start: @repeat(folk-saying, 4);
</PRE>
<P>Then, in the python-code section, you would define the "repeat" function:
<PRE>
;;
def repeat(rule, count):
    result = []
    for i in range(count):
        result.append(str(rule))
    return "".join(result)
</PRE>
Use str(rule) to generate a particular expansion of a rule.

<P>You can also use Names as parameters to rules, but use them to identify
something.  If you do so, you must refer to <parameter>.parts[0].name.
For instance,
<PRE>
Start: @set(this-product, product-name) " is great.  "
    "It's better than " @alternative(product-name, @get(this-product)) ".\n"
    "Buy " @get(this-product) " today!";

product-name: product-adj product-noun;
product-adj: "ultra" | "mega" | "dyna";
product-noun: "spam" | "parrot" | "python";
;;

d = {}
def set(name, val):
    name = name.parts[0].name
    d[name] = str(val)
    return d[name]

def get(name):
    name = name.parts[0].name
    return d[name]

def alternative(rule, excluded):
    e = str(excluded)
    while 1:
        s = str(rule)
        if s != e: return s
